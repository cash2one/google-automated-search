Google Automated Search

////////////////////////

DESCRIPTION

This program will search google for a set of RFP terms 
and store the first n results in an excel.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. Install Python 3.X (This was developed in 3.6)
2. Run 'pip install requests' in CMD
3. Run 'pip install beautifulsoup4' in CMD
3. Run 'pip install fake-useragent' in CMD
(pip should work after Python is installed. Otherwise, search google how to install pip-installer)

SETUP REQUIREMENTS

1. Setup Queries.txt with a list of queries to search for. List each query on a new line. For example, if you have 'Legislation' on one line, Google will search for 'RFP "Legislation" {date}".
2. Check the global variables in Program.py for any changes. I'd say they're okay as they are.

HOW TO RUN

1. Open Python IDLE
2. Choose File -> Open and locate Program.py
3. Choose Run -> Run Module
4. Follow any program instructions
